        Hey there! I'm Karthikeya, a third-year student at KL University who's passionate about full-stack development, UI/UX design, and exploring the creative possibilities of AI tools through prompt engineering. I love being a "vibe coder" - getting completely absorbed in building digital experiences from concept to deployment, whether that's crafting intuitive interfaces or architecting robust backends. Always excited to collaborate on innovative projects that push boundaries and solve real problems at the intersection of design, development, and AI.
